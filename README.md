# cctv-motion-detector
Use Diffcam to batch detect and save motion frame in a long list of CCTV videos.

I record CCTV from 3 cameras 24/7 using my own code (ffmpeg and ONVIF). 
it's a hassle to go through the footage to look for motion after some event. 
This code will run through a directory of CCTV videos and save frames with motion (you can define an area of interest).
It uses Diffcam.
